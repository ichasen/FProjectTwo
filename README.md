We have made a game, based on baseball
Rules:
There will be two players. One person will be the pitcher and the defender (will be called Player 1 here), and the other person will be the hitter (Player 2). The steps to play the game are the following:

1. Player 1 will pitch the ball using the “p” key on the left vertical meter. The goal is to press ‘p’ while the yellow circle is in the green area of the meter. 

2. The speed of the hitting meter (horizontal meter) will be based off of the timing of player 1’s pitch. Player 2 will then also try to time their hit using the space bar.

3. The quality of the hit will then, in turn, affect the speed of the defense meter (vertical meter at the right of the window). Player 1 will have to react quickly, and press the ‘l’ key at the right time. If Player 1 presses the ‘l’ key while the circle is in the green area, that person wins. Otherwise, player 2, or the hitter wins.

Features:
-responds to user key-pressing
-speed of each meter depends on outcome of the previous meter, and the outcome of the game depends on the timing of each meter
-ball-traveling animations are different depending on the type of hit

Stages of Development:
May 23 - May 24
Final Project repo created; Baseball game decided for the initial Prototype.
May 25 - June 2
Layout of game (background and bases) decided; Hitting meter is made at then end of this period.
June 3 - June 6
Pitching Meter created and the game is reworked to make Base a class.
June 6 - 8
Hitting meter is made to interact with the pitcher, allowing a basic skeleton of the game to be made.
June 8 - 10
The defense meter and and pitcher/ball sprites are made.  It is decided that the Hitter and Defense meters will not move back and forth in exchange for a lower overall speed.
